# The-Hangman-Game
The project is to design the famous game Hangman on computer using Python and SQL. In this project we ask the player to guess a four letter (level-1) or a five letter (level-2) word depending on the level, if he answers incorrectly then after two chances a hint is displayed that gives the name of topic of word and if he answers incorrectly his second last chance then again a hint is displayed that tells the player something special about the given word. After each wrong guess parts of hangman are formed simultaneously and a complete image of it is displayed if the player loses the game. The words and their two hints are stored in SQL which are linked with Python and randomly executed .The game has option to enable user to continue his game even after closing the playing window as the details can be stored in python according to the playerâ€™s wish.
